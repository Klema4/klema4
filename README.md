# 😊 About me
Hello everyone!

I'm Adam, an adult from Czech Republic building modern websites with passion and a lot of love. I'm developing on frontend for about 7 years and since then, I came across many new technologies as well as experiences when building websites. In my free time, I often go play badminton (playing since 2019), go for a walk or just relax and develop amazing things.
